Business Problem:
Netflix aims to derive meaningful insights from its extensive dataset of shows and movies to enhance the subscriber experience. However, with large volume of data, extracting valuable insights efficiently poses a challenge. They require a scalable and robust data analytics solution to process large volumes of data and identify key trends and patterns effectively.
________________________________________
Proposed Solution:
To help Netflix extract actionable insights from its vast dataset, we have leveraged SQL for data extraction and exploratory data analysis

â€¢	Using SQL, we have analyzed key metrics such as viewer ratings, popularity trends, genre preferences, and viewership patterns. 

SQL functions will help filter, aggregate, and structure the data for deeper analysis.
This approach will enable Netflix to make data-driven decisions, improving content recommendations and overall user engagement.
